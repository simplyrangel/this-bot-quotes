# this-bot-quotes
A Python-implemented Twitter bot that pulls a random quote from a .csv file, saves the quote to an image, and tweets the image with several hashtags. Tweets at regular intervals from the user's local computer until told to stop (aka control-c in the terminal). Not very elegant, but this is a weekend project by a code-ignorant engineer so have patience. The current interval is every (1) hours. 

Book quotes are sourced from personal notes I make after reading an especially engaging book. I will update the quotes regularly as avialable, and as I read more.
